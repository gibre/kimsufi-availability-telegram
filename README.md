This project is a simple PoC I did for fun because I was tired of refreshing the kimsufi webpage to have my server. Currently it is set staticly to check for KS-1 servers, but it could be enhanced in the futur. To use it, you need :
    * python 3
    * requests
    * python-telegram-bot

You also need to create a config.py file containing :
TOKEN ='token of your bot'
